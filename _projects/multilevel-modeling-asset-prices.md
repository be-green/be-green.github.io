This is a paper from when I was first learning about Bayesian hierarchical models that I wrote during my time at Capital Group, a large active investment firm. The gist is that if you embed Fama-French style regressions inside a hierarchical model with stock-level interactions you get far better risk forecasts out of sample (sort of a full-Bayes version of the insights in [Vasicek 1979](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2978759)).
