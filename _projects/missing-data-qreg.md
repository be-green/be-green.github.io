Missing data is a large problem in modern surveys, and a substantial subset of important variables lack any well-known parametric form. We relax parametric assumptions by using the quantile spacings approach of [Schmidt and Zhu](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2220901), interpolating the fitted quantiles with splines to generate a predictive distribution.
