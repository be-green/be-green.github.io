Using U.S. administrative data, we find that creative destruction in the product market passes through to worker earnings. This passthrough is both asymmetric and concentrated: profit drops from rival innovations lead to proportionally greater earning declines than profit gains from their own firm's innovations due to job destruction, while top workers are significantly more exposed than the average worker. We interpret the implications for worker welfare using a structural model featuring creative destruction in the product market. Our estimates imply significant welfare losses and demand for insurance for creative destruction.
