I've started to put together course materials for a set of workshops on working with data. The target audience is researchers or social scientists who might be comfortable with using programming languages for things like running regression models, but who are largely unfamiliar with actually programming.

You can [find the materials here](https://github.com/be-green/data-class). If you have additions or thoughts feel free to send a note.
