I'm an economist, software developer, and musician. I worked for four years at Capital Group, an active investment manager, on a team of data scientists and quantitative finance practitioners. I am currently a masters student at the University of Texas at Austin, and a research assistant for Russ Wermers at University of Maryland. This coming summer I will be a pre-doctoral research associate at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology in the finance department.

I very much enjoy playing music and cooking, and I dream about one day getting a dog.
