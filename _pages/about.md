I'm an economist, software developer, and musician. I worked for four years at Capital Group, an active investment manager, on a team of data scientists and quantitative finance practitioners. I got a master's in Economics from the University of Texas at Austin, and I'm currently working as a pre-doctoral research assistant in [Larry Schmidt's](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencedwschmidt/home) lab at MIT's Sloan School of Business.

I enjoy playing music and cooking, and I have two adorable cats.

# Projects

## Software

### My stuff
- [wrds](https://github.com/be-green/wrds): an R package for reliably connecting to the  Wharton Research Data Services back-end database, working directly with tables via SQL and dbplyr
- [quantspace](https://github.com/be-green/quantspace): an R package which helps to estimate distributional effects without quantile crossings, allowing full distributional forecasts
- [shinyrd](https://github.com/be-green/shinyrd): a package for a packaged, interactive multiverse analysis with regression discontinuity designs (very much a work in progress)

### Stuff I help with sometimes
- [baggr](https://github.com/wweicek/baggr): an R package for Bayesian meta-analysis models using Stan

### Retired (for now)
- [sec-filings](https://github.com/be-green/sec-filings): a prototype SEC filings parser for working with mutual fund filings

## Papers

### Stuff I work on when I have time
- Dynamic regularization and asset pricing tests
- Interactivity, private data, and multiverse analysis
