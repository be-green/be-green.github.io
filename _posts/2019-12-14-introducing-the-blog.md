My plans for the year are mostly to use this as a space to put up R tutorials for a set of intro seminars I'll be teaching in Spring 2020. I guess after that we'll see where it goes!

At the very least I'm hoping this becomes a searchable repository of nice R tutorials with a bent towards programming for research. Here is a completely unorganized list of topics I'm going to be touching on.

Data management and manipulation:
- Tidy data, tidyr, reshape, melt
- Interfacing with databases (sql)
- Working with xml & json
- Research project programming (e.g. cookiecutter, sqlite, etc.)
- High performance data munging with data.table
- Packages for working with weird data formats (e.g. data files from stata, sas, etc.)

Programming:
- Assignment, naming conventions, documenting your code
- Reading, searching, and understanding documentation
- Programming resources
- Pipes & functions
- Version control with git and github

Research:
- Reproducible research with RMarkdown

The WEB:
- What is a website, anyway?
- Webscraping with rvest
- Building static websites with hugo and/or jekyll

Visualization:
- Plotting with ggplot2
- Interactive plots with plotly & highcharts

This is basically a list of stuff I learned or taught myself that I've found valuable for research. Most of what I'm going to go through is in R since that's my safety blanket, but some of this stuff will apply more broadly.
